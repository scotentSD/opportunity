## How to use the template

a. Alter the Mmetadat as needed. 
 **optional** add the **type_of_event** if you want it displayed added to the heading when the post is clicked on (Lab Testing, Partner co-creation and co-design, Accessibility, Online research and testing, Events, F2F and testing) or leave empty if not needed
b. fill in the text of your post
. any files you want to link to should be uploaded before in the folder **files**
. to link a file, **`[name of your file to display (type of file)](../files/name-of-your-file.extenstion)`**

Remember to mention what type of file it is in the text link. For example: 

`[Partner Prioritisation Spreadsheet (Excel file)](../files/SEP-Partner-Prioritisation-020819-V1.xlsx)`
