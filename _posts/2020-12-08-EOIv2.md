tltitle: Expression of Interest (EOI) V2 Testing
---
## Phase: Discovery

## Audience and tool used
- Unmoderated testing on UserZoom with 10 people in Scotland who are business owners or decision makers
- We tested a Word document version and a web version

## Hypotheses
- People will welcome the Expression of Interest approach
- The form will make sense and be easy to use

## What we discovered

### People will welcome the Expression of Interest approach
- The online solution scores better than the word document BUT people want to be able to save their data

### The form will make sense and be easy to use
- The form makes overall sense
- People conflate EOI and pre-qualification
- The ability to save progress is valued
