## Phase: Discovery

## Audience and tool used
- Unmoderated testing on UserZoom with 10 people in Scotland who are business owners or decision makers
- This included a Survey Monkey version with a web page intro

## Research questions
- Does having the form as a Survey Monkey improve its usability and ease of use?

## What we discovered
- People were jarred by moving from a web page off to a SurveyMonkey without being explicitly informed what was about to happen
- But general usability was not impaired
