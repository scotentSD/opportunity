## Phase: Discovery

## Audience and tool used
- Unmoderated testing on UserZoom with people in Scotland who are business owners or decision makers

## Hypotheses
- People will welcome the Expression of Interest approach
- The form will make sense and be easy to use

## What we discovered

### People will welcome the Expression of Interest Approach
- People understand the benefits of the approach
- They think it will save them time in the long run
- Expect to not have to resubmit the same information again

BUT

- Would rather have a quick online solution that gives an immediate answer
- Have a solution that can be left and returned to with their data still saved

### The form will make sense and be easy to use
- Most of the sections of the form were clear, but there is room for improvement, particularly in the project information and outcomes sections
