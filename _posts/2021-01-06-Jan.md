### Phase: Discovery

### Audience and tool used
- Customers on User Zoom

### Focus
- how do users feel about third-party logins, would they use it
- mandatory Multiple Factors Authentication (MFA) for an account
- account locked aftet too many login attempt
- verification time

### What we discovered

- The most popular third-party sign-in options were Google and Microsoft, but **40% of users said they wouldn't use any third-party options for a business account**
- All users supported the idea of having MFA on a business account, but **60% thought it should be optional rather than mandatory**
- If a user's account gets locked because they entered an incorrect password too many times, most expect to be able to request a password reset via email rather than phoning someone
- Most users aren't willing to wait very long for their account to be verified, though they will wait slightly longer if they are applying for funding than business support
