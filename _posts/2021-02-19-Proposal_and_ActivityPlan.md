### Phase: Alpha

### Audience and tool used
- 6 potential customers, all SMEs
- Using video calls (Teams)

### Focus
- We tested the latest [service proposal](https://r5ql7s.axshare.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and we asked them to act as a company that wanted to reduce heating costs and lower carbon emissions, and protect jobs in the process of reducing costs

### What we discovered
- The content worked well
- Customers wanted a list of required info in order to prepare themselves
- Customers would appreciate an example project description to give them some idea how to structure theirs
- Customers are uncertain about what our help will cost
- The language presupposes a fully formed and costed Project. Many are at an earlier stage and may still be thinking in terms of problems and challenges
