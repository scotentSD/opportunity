## Audience and tool used
- 4 potential customers using F2F-Video calls (Microsoft Teams)
- 10 UserZoom online unmoderated tests

## What we tested
- [Sustainability specialist support](https://taob1x.axshare.com/#id=ktsx3n&p=specialist_sustainability_support&dp=0&fn=0&)
- [Accessing tailored support from our specialist teams](https://taob1x.axshare.com/#id=rqzfsa&p=accessing_tailored_support&dp=0&fn=0&) 

## Research questions
- Is there anything that’s unclear or missing?
- Is there anything users would have liked to know more about?
- Is the language clear/do we use any unfamiliar terms?
- Does the splitting over the two pages helpful?
- Is the eligibility criteria clear?

## What we discovered
- The language sounds like “management speak”
- “Not everyone who is reading this has been to business school”
- Bullet points could be more concise
- People are very time poor
- Help and support are used interchangeably
- The second page is much clearer
- The language does not really tell businesses “what’s in it for them”
- There were no strong feelings about the two page layout
- The eligibility and required outcomes were fairly clear
