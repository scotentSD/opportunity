## Audience and tool used
- 6 potential customers (face-to-face on Teams)

## What we tested
- [The latest OM wireframe](https://taob1x.axshare.com/#id=8pdqr7&p=project_opp_support_section_overview&fn=0&dp=0) 

## Results
- There are two paths that are clear to customers. The text around the 'Enquire' path suggests a conversation. When users click through they see a standard Contact Us form and little language
to sustain their expectations.
- The 'Apply' path does meet expectations
- The form is clean, clear and easy to understand
- The account creation is at the appropriate time in the journey and IS expected
- The document requirements (passport, driving license, other) were acceptable to all participants
