## Audience and tool used
- 5 potential customers (face-to-face on Teams)

## What we tested
- [The latest OM wireframe](https://taob1x.axshare.com/#id=8pdqr7&p=project_opp_support_section_overview) 
- Scenario: Covid has disrupted your business over the last year, and you are looking for new income streams.You are not sure how to do that and you want us to help you.

## What we focused on
- Customer understanding of language
- Happy path customer flow

## Results
- The service descriptions have specific issues and this also varies with customer industry
- There was more reticence than last time, over using personal documents (passport, driving license, other)
