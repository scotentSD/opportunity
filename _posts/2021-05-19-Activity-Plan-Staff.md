## Phase: Alpha

## Audience and tool used
- 6 staff members (4 who were part of the pilot, 2 who weren't part of the original pilot group)

## What we tested
- The Word document version of the Activity Plan that was used for the OM pilot project

## Research questions
- What were they trying to achieve with the activity plan?
- What was their experience of using the activity plan?
- What worked well for them?
- What didn't work so well for them?
- How did they share the activity plan and any updates with customers?
- Did they have to adapt the plan to meet the needs of their project?
- Are there changes that could be made to the plan to make their jobs easier?

## What we discovered
- The outcomes and actions section is useful
- The activity plan works better for some types of projects than others
- There is duplication from the EOI
- Businesses are reluctant to sign off on the plans because it's too much like a contract
- The plan and the wording could be simplified to be more customer-friendly
