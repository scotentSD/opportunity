## Phase: Alpha

## Audience and tool used
- 7 people from 5 companies that were part of the pilot

## What we tested
- The Word document version of the Activity Plan that was used for the OM pilot project

## Research questions
- What was their experience of using the activity plan?
- What worked well?
- What didn't work so well?
- Was there anything missing that they expected to be there?
- What format would they want to receive the plan in?
- How were they being informed/would they want to be informed about updates to the activity plan?

## What we discovered
- Companies aren't that interested in the activity plan
  - "I don't care what's on a piece of paper."
  - "The activity plan didn't really register."
  - "The document itself â€“ I never really opened it."
- The real value for companies is in the conversations they have with us
 - It all comes down to the people
