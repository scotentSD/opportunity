## Audience and tool used
- 30 users on UserTesting.com
  - 15 in Scotland
  - 15 UK-wide
  - Job roles: Senior, Owner, Manager, Director or above

## What we tested
- The [sales pitch](https://scotentsd.github.io/md/) email to pro-actively encourage people to apply for OM support
- Three different email subject headings:
  - Tailored specialist support to develop your business
  - Want to get specialist support for your business?
  - You may be eligible for specialist business support

## Research questions
- Which email subject header do they prefer?
- Do companies understand what it is that we're offering?
- Is there anything that is confusing or unclear in the pitch?
- Would they be motivated to apply after reading this pitch?

## What we discovered
- Most people who viewed the content would be motivated to click 'Apply'
- All three subject headings received similar scores
  - 'Tailored specialist support for your business' was voted the mostly likely to make you want to read the rest of the email
  - 'Want to get specialist support for your business?' was voted most engaging
- Most people find the content clear and easy to understand, but they could use some clarity around:
  - Eligibility criteria
  - What support is on offer
  - How we deliver support
  - What our qualifications are

## ðŸŽ§ Quotes

| Quote

| "I'd probably want to find out more any aspects of support I'm most interested in before applying. So a link to the website would be more likely to get a click than the Apply button. I like to do my research first."
| "I think it is clear. In my own words, it is you sharing your expertise and experience to help me grow my business, support in making the right decision on what needs done next, support in getting funding and help in networking."
| "The bullet points are very clear and simple to understand, it could be a bit more comprehensive and offer examples of what's on offer. For example, guidance and insights is quite subjective...just go one step further to tell me what's available."
| "It is clear on what the page is offering. Using bullet points makes it a lot easier to read and understand."  
| "I think there is just enough info on the page to peak my interest, it's not information overload and it's all very positive, clear and well laid out!"
