# Overview


## Customers'expectations
- Customers are expecting services that are easy to use, personalised, based on their needs and what they have told us about themselves
- They expect us not to ask the same information twice and to be clear on how we will use their data and keep it safe
- They want to be able to contact us in a way that works for them 

## A customer portal account will allow

- Link services to make user journeys simpler
- Consistent and accurate data source so we can make better decisions
- Being more transparent by playing back the information we hold to our customers
